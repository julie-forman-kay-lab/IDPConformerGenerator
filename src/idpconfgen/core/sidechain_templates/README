Residues were rotated 1 radian around the z axis so that neither N or C is in aligned with the N or C of the builder process. N in the building process is set to the origin and the CA to the x axis. The original version of these templates had N along the -x axis and CA in origin, which makes N-CA of both backbone and sidechain template aligned for the first residue in the protein during the building process. To avoid boolean flags during the building process, I rotated all the template sidechain coordinates.

Original templates from Teresa Head-Gordon data.

Code use for rotation is as follows:

```python
import sys
from math import sin, cos
from pathlib import Path

import numpy as np

from idpconfgen.libs.libstructure import Structure
from idpconfgen.libs.libcalc import hamiltonian_multiplication_Q as QM


def Q_rotate(coords, rot_vec, angle_rad):
    """
    Rotate coordinates by radians along an axis.

    Uses quaternion operations as defined in the IDPConfGen package.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coords : nd.array (N, 3), dtype=np.float64
        The coordinates to ratote.

    angle_rad : float
        The angle in radians to rotate the coords.

    rot_vec : (,3)
        A 3D space vector around which to rotate coords.

    Returns
    -------
    nd.array shape (N, 3), dtype=np.float64
        The rotated coordinates
    """
    #assert coords.dim == 2
    assert coords.shape[1] == 3

    b2, b3, b4 = sin(angle_rad / 2) * rot_vec
    b1 = cos(angle_rad / 2)

    c1, c2, c3, c4 = QM(b1, b2, b3, b4, 0, coords[:, 0], coords[:, 1], coords[:, 2])
    d1, d2, d3, d4 = QM(c1, c2, c3, c4, b1, -b2, -b3, -b4)
    rotated = np.array([d2, d3, d4]).T

    assert rotated.shape[1] == 3
    return rotated

aa = Path(sys.argv[1])
s = Structure(aa)
s.build()

coords = s.coords

angle = 1
vector = np.array([0, 0, 1])

ncoords = Q_rotate(coords, vector, angle)
s.coords = ncoords
s.write_PDB(f'{sys.argv[1]}')
```
