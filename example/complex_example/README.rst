Modeling Disordered Regions in a Multi-Chain Protein Complex
============================================================

.. start-description

The following example will walk you through building intrinsically disordered
regions on multiple chains of a protein complex using the Local Disordered
Region Sampling (LDRS ``ldrs`` subclient).

.. note::
    Please ensure all sequences are within the .FASTA file even for chains
    you are not interested in LDRS processing. This will help LDRS determine
    which chain to process.

    Please refer to ``D1D2.fasta`` for a formating example.

For this exercise, we will be constructing a combination of the three cases of
N-IDR, L-IDR, and C-IDR on both chain A and chain B of the crystal structure of the
D1D2 sub-complex from the human SNRNP core domain. Please enter the example 
:code:`example/complex_example` folder where you will find the complete set of
sequences: ``D1D2.fasta``, and a PDB of the complex from the
RCSB PDB ID 1B34: ``1B34.pdb``.

Steps from now will assume you're in the ``example/complex_example`` directory and
have already created your preferred reusable IDPConformerGenerator *database*.
For instructions on the database, please visit the previous exercise "A Real
Case Scenario".

Due to the automated process of multi-chain detection and building we can generate
a set of 10 structures with a single command::

    idpconfgen ldrs \
        -db <PATH TO DATABASE.JSON> \
        -seq D1D2.fasta \
        -nc 10 \
        -fld 1B34.pdb \
        --dloop-off \
        --dany \
        -of ./D1D2_ldrs_ANY_faspr \
        -n

The ``ldrs`` subclient with automatically detect the all IDRs and their corresponding
chains based on sequence similarity and mismatches in the primary sequence of the ``.fasta``
file and the PDB file of the folded domain. This command took approximately an hour on a
single workstation with 64 GB DDR4 RAM and 10 CPU threads (``-n 10``) clocked at 3.0 GHz.
