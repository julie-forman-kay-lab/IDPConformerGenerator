IDPConformerGenerator
=======================

.. start-description

IDPConformerGenerator is a flexible, modular platform for generating ensembles
of disordered protein states that builds conformers by sampling backbone torsion
angles of relevant sequence fragments extracted from protein structures in the
RCSB Protein Data Bank.

IDPConformerGenerator can efficiently build large and diverse conformer pools of
disordered proteins, with user defined options enabling variable fractional
population of secondary structures, including matching those assigned based on
NMR chemical shift data. These conformer pools are intended to be utilized as
input for further approaches to match experimental data, such as re-weighting or
sub-setting algorithms.
